# Un-Trademark

This Firefox addon turns unnecessary trademarks into the normal common word that they refer to.. It was created because of annoyance with Apple Watch reporting, so the initial version converts "digital crown" to "knob" and "taptic engine" to "vibrator". Please open an issue if you have other words and phrases to fix.
